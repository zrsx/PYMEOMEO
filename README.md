# PYMEOMEO

> **Advanced Python Obfuscation and Protection Suite**

**PYMEOMEO** is a next-generation, high-performance framework for Python code protection. It is purpose-built to safeguard proprietary source code against reverse engineering, static analysis, and decompilation in both professional and enterprise environments.

---

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Obfuscation**: Employs advanced code transformation techniques to maximize code confidentiality and impede reverse engineering efforts.
- **Multi-Layer Protection**: Optional encryption and compression layers further increase code complexity and reduce script footprint.
- **Dynamic Code Execution**: Supports runtime code generation, enhancing unpredictability and resilience.
- **Integrated Anti-Analysis**: Incorporates robust anti-debugging and anti-decompilation features to resist both static and dynamic inspection.
- **Python Version Enforcement**: Ensures protected code executes only on authorized Python versions.
- **Intuitive Command-Line Interface**: Designed for ease of use with a streamlined, professional workflow.
- **Optimized Performance**: Engineered for efficient, large-scale obfuscation tasks.
- **Self-Contained Outputs**: Generates standalone, protected Python scripts with embedded integrity checks.
- **Traceable Build Metadata**: Supports user and build tagging for distribution control and auditing.
- **Ongoing Development**: Actively maintained and updated for continued compatibility and security enhancements.

---

## Requirements

- **Python Versions Supported**: 3.10 â€“ 3.13  
- **Dependency**:  
  - [`pystyle`](https://pypi.org/project/pystyle/) (`pip install pystyle`)

---

## Usage

Select and execute the obfuscator script matching your Python version:

- **Python 3.10**
  ```bash
  python3.10 _bes310.py
  ```
- **Python 3.11**
  ```bash
  python3.11 _bes311.py
  ```
- **Python 3.12**
  ```bash
  python3.12 _bes312.py
  ```
- **Python 3.13**
  ```bash
  python3.13 _bes313.py
  ```

---

## Best Practices

- **Always test your obfuscated scripts** in a controlled environment matching your intended deployment.
- **Retain backup copies** of your original source code as obfuscation is a one-way process.
- **Review output scripts** for any compatibility issues specific to your Python runtime.
- **Consult documentation and changelogs** for details about updates and compatibility notes.

## Security & Anti-Tamper

PYMEOMEO includes advanced, proprietary anti-debugging and anti-analysis mechanisms designed to proactively detect and disrupt unauthorized inspection or tampering.  
Key defensive strategies include:

- Runtime environment verification and integrity checks.
- Defensive measures against common debugging and reverse engineering tools.
- Dynamic behavior to further complicate automated analysis and decompilation.
- Continuous enhancement to address evolving security threats.

*Details of internal security mechanisms are proprietary and not publicly disclosed to preserve effectiveness.*

## Example Workflow

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pystyle
   ```

2. **Prepare your source script** (e.g., `main.py`).

3. **Run the obfuscator:**
   ```bash
   python3.10 _bes310.py --input main.py --output main_protected.py
   ```

4. **Deploy your protected script** using the same Python version as used for obfuscation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does PYMEOMEO guarantee absolute code security?**  
A: While PYMEOMEO provides state-of-the-art protection, no software obfuscation can guarantee absolute security against all possible attacks. It is a critical layer in a comprehensive security strategy.

**Q: What Python features are supported?**  
A: PYMEOMEO supports a wide range of Python code constructs and is regularly updated to maintain compatibility with the latest language features.

**Q: Can I use the obfuscated code on other platforms?**  
A: Yes, provided the target system uses a compatible Python interpreter version.

**Q: Are there any performance impacts?**  
A: Obfuscated code may incur a slight performance overhead due to added protection layers, but PYMEOMEO is optimized for minimal disruption.

**Q: How can I report issues or request features?**  
A: Please open an issue on the GitHub repository or contact the maintainers directly.
