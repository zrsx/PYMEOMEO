# PYMEOMEO

> **Next-Generation Python Obfuscation and Protection Suite**

**PYMEOMEO** is an advanced, high-performance obfuscation framework for Python, engineered to protect intellectual property and prevent reverse engineering, static analysis, and decompilation of Python source code.

---

## Key Features

- **Advanced Obfuscation Engine**: Sophisticated transformations to obscure Python logic.
- **Multi-Layered Encryption & Compression**: Optional encryption and compression stages to increase complexity and reduce size.
- **Dynamic Code Execution**: Enables runtime code generation and evaluation.
- **Anti-Debugging & Anti-Decompilation**: Implements techniques to detect and mitigate debugging or decompilation attempts.
- **Version-Specific Runtime Locking**: Ensures obfuscated output only runs on intended Python versions.
- **Clean and Intuitive Interface**: Designed for both CLI and script-based integration.
- **Optimized Processing Speed**: High-performance routines minimize obfuscation time.
- **Self-Contained Output**: Produces standalone protected files with no external dependencies.
- **User & Build Tagging**: Supports custom tagging for traceability and packaging.
