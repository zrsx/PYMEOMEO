# PYMEOMEO

> **Next-Generation Python Obfuscation and Protection Suite**

**PYMEOMEO** is a high-performance, next-gen obfuscation framework for Python, designed to protect proprietary source code from reverse engineering, static analysis, and decompilation.

---

## Key Features

- **Advanced Obfuscation Engine** — Sophisticated transformations that obscure Python code structures and logic.
- **Multi-Layer Encryption & Compression** — Optional layers to increase code complexity and reduce footprint.
- **Dynamic Code Execution** — Enables runtime code generation and execution to increase unpredictability.
- **Anti-Debugging & Anti-Decompilation** — Detects and resists reverse engineering attempts.
- **Version-Based Runtime Locking** — Ensures obfuscated code only runs on specific Python versions.
- **Clean and User-Friendly Interface** — Simple CLI-driven workflow with intuitive operation.
- **High-Speed Processing** — Optimized for rapid obfuscation at scale.
- **Self-Contained Output** — Generates fully standalone protected scripts.
- **User & Build Tagging** — Embed traceable metadata for distribution or audit purposes.
